# Linear MCP Server Project Summary

## Overview

This project provides a comprehensive design and implementation blueprint for a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that integrates with Linear's API. The server enables MCP clients like Claude Desktop and Cursor to interact with Linear for creating work items from feature lists and searching for issues, projects, documents, templates, and other resources.

## Key Components

1. **MCP Protocol Layer**: Handles MCP client connections, message parsing, and capability negotiation
2. **Linear Integration Layer**: Connects to Linear's GraphQL API and implements feature list processing and search functionality
3. **Authentication and Security**: Manages API keys, implements secure communication, and handles permissions
4. **Error Handling and Logging**: Provides robust error handling and comprehensive logging

## Features

### Feature List to Work Item Conversion

The server supports converting feature lists to Linear work items in multiple formats:

- Plain text format (line-by-line features)
- Markdown format (with metadata extraction)
- JSON format (fully structured feature data)

Features include:
- Metadata extraction and enrichment
- Batch creation of issues
- Project and team context
- Label and assignee management

### Search Functionality

Comprehensive search capabilities across Linear resources:

- Issues (with filtering by status, assignee, project, team, labels, etc.)
- Projects (with filtering by status, team, etc.)
- Documents, templates, and other resources
- Unified search across multiple resource types

### Authentication and Security

Robust security features:

- API key authentication with Linear
- Optional OAuth support
- MCP server authentication
- TLS/SSL encryption
- Secure configuration management

### Error Handling and Logging

Comprehensive error handling and logging:

- Structured error responses
- Detailed logging with multiple levels
- Request tracing with correlation IDs
- Performance monitoring

## Implementation Approach

The implementation blueprint provides:

- Detailed project structure
- Key component implementations with code examples
- Implementation sequence
- Technical considerations for performance, security, and reliability

## Deployment Options

Multiple deployment options are supported:

- Docker deployment (recommended for most use cases)
- Kubernetes deployment (for production environments)
- Manual deployment (for development or testing)

Each option includes detailed instructions, security considerations, and monitoring guidance.

## Usage Examples

The documentation includes comprehensive usage examples for:

- Claude Desktop: Creating work items, searching for issues, project management
- Cursor: Code-to-issue workflows, project planning, integration with development workflow

## Next Steps

To implement this design:

1. Set up the development environment
2. Follow the implementation sequence in the blueprint
3. Implement core components (MCP protocol, Linear integration)
4. Add feature list processing and search functionality
5. Implement authentication and security features
6. Add error handling and logging
7. Test thoroughly
8. Deploy using the provided instructions

## Conclusion

This project provides a complete design for a Linear MCP server that enables powerful integration between MCP clients and Linear. The design is modular, secure, and scalable, with comprehensive documentation for implementation, deployment, and usage.
