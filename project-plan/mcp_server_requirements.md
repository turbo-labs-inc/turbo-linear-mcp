# MCP Server Requirements for Linear Integration

## Overview
This document defines the requirements for an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that integrates with Linear's API to provide work item creation from feature lists and comprehensive search functionality.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Authentication and Security
- **REQ-1.1**: Support API key authentication for Linear API access
- **REQ-1.2**: Securely store and manage API keys
- **REQ-1.3**: Implement proper error handling for authentication failures
- **REQ-1.4**: Support MCP protocol authentication mechanisms
- **REQ-1.5**: Provide clear documentation on authentication setup

### 2. Feature List to Work Item Conversion
- **REQ-2.1**: Parse feature lists in various formats (plain text, markdown, structured JSON)
- **REQ-2.2**: Convert individual features to Linear issues with appropriate fields
- **REQ-2.3**: Support batch creation of multiple issues from a feature list
- **REQ-2.4**: Allow specification of target project, team, and other metadata
- **REQ-2.5**: Support templates for consistent issue creation
- **REQ-2.6**: Provide feedback on creation status and results
- **REQ-2.7**: Handle errors gracefully during conversion process

### 3. Search Functionality
- **REQ-3.1**: Implement comprehensive search across Linear issues
- **REQ-3.2**: Support searching by text, labels, assignees, and other metadata
- **REQ-3.3**: Enable project-specific searching
- **REQ-3.4**: Support searching for templates and documents
- **REQ-3.5**: Implement pagination for search results
- **REQ-3.6**: Provide relevant and useful result formatting
- **REQ-3.7**: Support complex filtering with multiple conditions

### 4. MCP Protocol Compliance
- **REQ-4.1**: Implement MCP server specification
- **REQ-4.2**: Support required MCP message formats and communication patterns
- **REQ-4.3**: Expose Linear capabilities as MCP resources and tools
- **REQ-4.4**: Handle MCP client connections properly
- **REQ-4.5**: Support capability negotiation with MCP clients

### 5. Error Handling and Logging
- **REQ-5.1**: Implement comprehensive error handling
- **REQ-5.2**: Provide meaningful error messages to clients
- **REQ-5.3**: Log errors and important events
- **REQ-5.4**: Handle Linear API rate limiting gracefully
- **REQ-5.5**: Recover from transient failures when possible

## Non-Functional Requirements

### 1. Performance
- **REQ-NF-1.1**: Respond to client requests within reasonable timeframes
- **REQ-NF-1.2**: Handle multiple concurrent client connections
- **REQ-NF-1.3**: Optimize Linear API usage to minimize rate limit impacts

### 2. Reliability
- **REQ-NF-2.1**: Gracefully handle Linear API outages or errors
- **REQ-NF-2.2**: Implement appropriate retry mechanisms
- **REQ-NF-2.3**: Ensure data consistency during operations

### 3. Usability
- **REQ-NF-3.1**: Provide clear documentation for setup and usage
- **REQ-NF-3.2**: Design intuitive tool interfaces for MCP clients
- **REQ-NF-3.3**: Implement helpful error messages and guidance

### 4. Maintainability
- **REQ-NF-4.1**: Use modular design for easier updates and extensions
- **REQ-NF-4.2**: Follow coding best practices and standards
- **REQ-NF-4.3**: Include comprehensive documentation
- **REQ-NF-4.4**: Design for future API changes from Linear

### 5. Compatibility
- **REQ-NF-5.1**: Ensure compatibility with specified MCP clients (Claude Desktop, Cursor)
- **REQ-NF-5.2**: Support current Linear API version
- **REQ-NF-5.3**: Design for forward compatibility with future MCP protocol versions

## Constraints
- Must use API key authentication as specified by the user
- Must comply with Linear API rate limits
- Must follow MCP protocol specifications
- Must be designed as a specification/blueprint rather than a working prototype

## Assumptions
- Users will have valid Linear API keys
- Linear API will remain stable in its core functionality
- MCP clients will follow the protocol specification
- Feature lists will have some level of consistent formatting

This requirements document will guide the design and implementation of the MCP server for Linear integration, ensuring all user needs are addressed.
